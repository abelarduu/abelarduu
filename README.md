### About Me
_Python programmer | Graphic Design | Pixel Artist | Indie Game Developer_

Hello! My name is Abel Lucas and I've been a Python programmer, graphic designer, pixel artist, and indie game developer for a good while. I'm passionate about programming and all aspects involved in software and game development, from design and UX/UI to management and its methodologies. I'm always seeking to learn more and improve in all these areas. Open to collaborations and new challenges! My favorite languages are Python, Gdscript, and Ruby.
